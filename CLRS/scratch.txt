This article introduced a new kind of biosensor that is capable of continuously measuring and 
monitoring specific molecules in the bloodstream and uses those information to make sure every 
patients get the optimal drug doses for their own situations. And this biosensor called 
microfluidic electrochemical detector for in vivo continuous monitoring, MEDIC for abbreviation. 

The article introduced the background of the continuous, real-time measurement tech and illustrated
the difficulties for current development real-time tracking biosensor. And actually those difficulties
are also the basic and general ideas for the therapeutic that this kind of biosensors used for. This
principle is "the right drug, at the right dose, and at the right time" according to the article. 

Basically, the design of this real-time measurement device has three main challenges. The first is the
problem of continuous operation. The second is the high sensitivity requirements of device. The last
one is the high resistance of other interferents to keep high SNRs for long period using purpose.

For the first problem, MEDIC device used a conformation-changing aptamer probe to bind the target molecule.
And this probe is attached on one terminus to an electrode within the MEDIC device. That means this probe
can detect for a specific molecule and undergoes the conformational rearrangement of molecule continuously.
Consequently, this conformational rearrangement could generate electrochemical signal that could be used
as the data of monitoring. In addition, the continuous-flow diffusion filter(CDF) protect the probe from
other interferents.
